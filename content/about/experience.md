  - title: Research Assistant in Risk and Resilience 
    company: University College London / DARe Hub
    company_url: ''
    company_logo: dare_logo
    location: Remote
    date_start: '2025-05-01'
    date_end: 'Current'
    description: |2-
        * Developed a GIS-based, multi-hazard risk assessment framework to identify critical corridors and nodes across the UK’s multi-modal freight network, supporting prioritization of resilience interventions for flooding, waterlogging, and landslides.
        * Applied spatial risk analysis methods, including the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), to integrate climate, infrastructure, and network datasets and assess transport vulnerability under multiple hazard scenarios.
        * Modeled operational and economic disruption impacts across both road and rail freight systems, evaluating system-wide consequences of extreme weather events.
        * Designed and implemented a live-updating, GIS-based dashboard that integrates weather, traffic, and network data to support freight routing decisions and identify potential delays in near real time.
        * Collaborated with a multidisciplinary research team and external stakeholders to align analytical outputs with real-world transport adaptation and resilience planning needs.
        * Translated complex analytical results into clear technical documentation and summaries to support ongoing tool development, internal decision-making, and external dissemination.

  - title: GIS Technician I
    company: ASRC Federal
    company_url: ''
    company_logo: asrc_logo
    location: Remote
    date_start: '2023-05-31'
    date_end: '2024-09-12'
    description: |2-
        * Supported the maintenance and enhancement of live GIS datasets in a secure production environment, working with street centerlines, parcels, and related spatial layers.
        * Reviewed, edited, and validated spatial features and attribute data using ArcGIS and custom map production tools to ensure consistency and positional accuracy.
        * Conducted parcel- and address-level QA/QC by integrating county and locally sourced GIS data within web-based and desktop GIS workflows.
        * Applied cartographic and spatial analysis principles to revise geometries, resolve layer conflicts (e.g., road and hydrography overlaps), and implement supervisor-defined edit instructions.
        * Worked within daily production schedules, using standardized procedures and automated tools to support reliable, repeatable GIS data updates.

  - title: Survey Technician Intern
    company: Balzer and Associates
    company_url: ''
    company_logo: balzer_logo
    location: Richmond, Virginia
    date_start: '2022-05-17'
    date_end: '2022-08-22'
    description: |2-
        * Supported commercial and residential land surveying projects by working directly with field crews across multiple job sites throughout Virginia.
        * Operated standard land surveying equipment (e.g., total stations) to locate property corners and collect precise field measurements for boundary, traverse, and mortgage surveys.
        * Assisted with staking and layout for site features including footings, clearings, and brick points, ensuring accuracy and adherence to project specifications.
        * Gained hands-on experience in the fundamentals of spatial data collection, survey control, and field-based quality checks that underpin downstream mapping and GIS workflows.
        * Collaborated closely with survey crew members to follow established procedures, maintain data integrity, and support efficient daily field operations.
