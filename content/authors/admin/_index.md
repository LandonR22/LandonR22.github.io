I’m a recent MSc Geospatial Sciences graduate from UCL with experience in multi-hazard risk assessment, climate resilience research, and spatial data science. I build GIS- and Python-based workflows that translate complex spatial and climate datasets into actionable insight for infrastructure planning, risk analysis, and decision-making.

My recent work includes multi-hazard exposure and disruption-cost modeling for freight corridors, geospatial data quality and validation in operational settings, and reproducible analytics across GIS and machine learning projects.
