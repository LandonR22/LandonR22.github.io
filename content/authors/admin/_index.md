My work focuses on using spatial and quantitative analysis to support evidence-based analysis and decision-making across infrastructure, environmental, and planning contexts.

My recent work includes multi-hazard exposure and disruption-cost modeling for freight corridors, geospatial data quality and validation in operational environments, and reproducible analytics across GIS and machine learning projects.
