I’m a recent MSc Geospatial Sciences graduate from University College London (UCL) with experience working at the intersection of spatial analysis, environmental data, and infrastructure systems. My interests lie in understanding how climate and infrastructure systems interact, and in using geospatial analysis to support more resilient, data-informed decision-making.
