I’m a recent MSc Geospatial Sciences graduate from University College London (UCL) with experience in multi-hazard risk assessment, climate resilience research, and spatial data science. My work focuses on translating complex geospatial and climate data into actionable insights for infrastructure, risk, and decision-making contexts.
