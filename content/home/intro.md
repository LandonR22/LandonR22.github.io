I’m a recent MSc Geospatial Sciences graduate from University College London (UCL) with experience in multi-hazard risk assessment, climate resilience research, and spatial data science. My interests lie in understanding how climate and infrastructure systems interact, and in using geospatial analysis to support more resilient, data-informed decision-making.
